# MERN BUS Application

This project is developed by CODCrafters following Indian repo, initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Under the guidance of Usman Ghias, our team has created a robust and dynamic application designed to meet modern development standards and best practices.

## Introduction

This application serves as a foundation for building single-page applications using React. It includes several pre-configured scripts to enhance development workflow and optimize production builds for better performance and scalability.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `yarn start`

- **Function:** Starts the development server.
- **Access:** Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.
- **Features:** Live reloading and lint error visibility in the console.

### `yarn test`

- **Function:** Runs tests using the interactive watch mode.
- **Details:** Learn more about running tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `yarn build`

- **Function:** Compiles the application for production to the `build` folder.
- **Optimizations:** Ensures optimal bundling with React in production mode, including minification and filename hashing for cache management.
- **Deployment:** Ready for deployment post-build. More about deployment [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `yarn eject`

- **Warning:** This is an irreversible operation.
- **Purpose:** Provides an escape hatch for developers wanting more control over configuration and dependencies.
- **Note:** Post-ejection, you will need to manage configuration files and dependencies directly.

## Advanced Features

- **Code Splitting:** Reduce load time by splitting code into various bundles which can be loaded on demand. Learn more [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting).
- **Bundle Analysis:** Tools and tips for analyzing bundle size can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size).
- **Progressive Web App:** Steps to convert your application into a PWA are detailed [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app).
- **Advanced Configurations:** Further customization and advanced configurations are described [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration).
